Welcome to DETOUR's API documentation!
======================================

DETOUR is a regression testing tool for autonomous driving systems. From a given set of tests (defined as road structures) it selects/prioritizes those in which an automated driving system is more likely to drive off the lane.

DETOUR provides a standalone executable detour that allows running it by supplying test cases in json files.

DETOUR is also a library that provides modules/classes/functions that can be utilized in python projects. This documentation provides an overview of DETOUR as a library.
